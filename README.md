## Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

## Functions

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## How to Run:

- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm start`.
- App can be seen at: http://localhost:3000.
